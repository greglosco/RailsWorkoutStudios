## Usage

The Workout Studio Reviewer is a an app for users to organize the workout studios they've attended, as well as rate their experiences and write reviews. A user can create a new account with a username, email, and password or login with existing account information; they can also login via OmniAuth with Github login credentials. A user can add a new studio to be rated and reviewed, view the studios they've previously added, or view all studios logged by all users of the app. A user can similarly write a review of any studio they've added, view the reviews they've previously written, view all reviews written in the app, and view reviews that have specifically garnered five-star reviews. A user will only have editing and deleting privileges over the studios and reviews they've added. A user can edit their login credentials, log out, or delete their account.
